For decades, game design has relied on intuition and playtesting. What makes a game fun? Why do some mechanics feel engaging while others fall flat? These questions have remained largely subjective—until now.

The **Theory of Anticipation (ToA)** provides the first mathematical framework for quantifying engagement, offering an objective and computable measure of what we commonly call "fun."

## The Core Insight

At its heart, the theory measures the **uncertainty of meaningfulness** of future branches. Think about what makes moments in games exciting: it's when you're unsure about meaningful outcomes. Too predictable is boring. Too random feels pointless.

The Local Anticipation (A₁) for a given state captures this perfectly:
